## pd tag add

Add <tagname> --flags <names or ids>

### Synopsis

Add <tagname> to the specified objects. If the tag does not exist
it will be created. Flags may be repeated, or may be passed multiple values
separated by comma. Some flags take object names, others take only IDs.

```
pd tag add [flags]
```

### Examples

```
These two are equivalent:
pd add my_tag --branch main,other,feature
pd add my_tag --branch main --branch other --branch feature

Multiple objects may be tagged in a single invocation:
pd add my_tag --branch main,other,feature --commit 01FTXY1D4FQEN7STPBWY2J2T5Q

If a tag fails to apply to one of the objects, an error will be reported for
that object, and application will continue for the remaining objects.

```
