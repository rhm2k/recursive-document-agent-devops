## pd workspace history

Show history for current workspace

### Synopsis

Show history for current workspace. The output is an ordered list of changes
made during the workspace. Version IDs are included in the output, along with a
brief summary of the changes captured in each version.

A specific state in the history may be returned to by passing --promote and
supplying the history entry number or a version id. Promoting a version appends
that entry to the history, and alters the workspace's working dataset to match
the dataset that was active at that point in the workspace's history

```
