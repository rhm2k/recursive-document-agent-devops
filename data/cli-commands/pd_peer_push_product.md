## pd peer push product

Push commits from the specified product / release to <peername>

### Synopsis

Push commits (and the records contained in those commits) from the
product on <peername> into the repository, into the branch specified by
--into-branch. If --into-branch is not specified, a new branch will be created
in the form of "<peer>_<productname>_<pushid>".

If --release is not specified, commits and records from all (non-deprecated)
releases will be pushed. Each release will land as a commit in the local
branch, with the commit comment containing the release id
