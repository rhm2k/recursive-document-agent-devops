## pd product release

Release the specified commit contant as product <productname>, with the specified release version

### Synopsis

Release the specified commit content as product <productname>, with the
specified release version. Specifiying major, minor, or patch will bump the
version accordingly. When specifying --type pre, --pretext is required. If
major, mnor or patch is specified and pretext is supplied, the appropriate
version is bumped and pretext is appended. To promote a pre-release to a full
release, specify --type removepre.

To attach a specific license to this release, use --license <license name>.
If no license is specified, the license applied to the product (if any) will be
applied to this release.

```
pd product release --name <productname> --commit <commitID> --type [major|minor|patch|pre|removepre] [--pretext <text>] [--license <license name>] [--userdata /path/to/userdata.json] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
Create a new product at version 0.0.1:
	pd product release --name MyProduct --commit 123 --type patch

Release that same product, with the same commit, as version 1.0.0:
	pd product release --name MyProduct --commit 123 --type major

Prepare a pre-release 2.0.0.some_pre_text with new commit content:
	pd product release --name MyProduct --commit 456 --type major --pretext some_pre_text

Create a new major release 2.0.0. removing the pre tag:
	pd product release --name MyProduct --commit 456 --type removepre

Specifying --pre is probably not what you want, as it will add pretext to the current release:

	pd product release --name MyProduct --commit 456 --type pre "going_backward"

This results in release "2.0.0.going_backwards" which is conceptually before "2.0.0".

```
