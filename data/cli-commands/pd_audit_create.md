## pd audit create

Provides audit of records contained in submitted files

### Synopsis

Create and display an audit report using the records contained in the
submitted files, referenced commit, or from the active dataset of the current
workspace.

The report contains all records in the repository that resemble the submitted
content, and all events associated with each of those matches.

```
pd audit create [--files /path/to/file(s) | --commit <id> | --workspace] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
pd audit create --files ./path/to/file
Generates an audit report from the contents of the file, using the default values.

pd audit create --name myaudit ./path/to/file --threshold 1.0 --include retrieve
Creates an audit report from the contents of ./path/to/file, reporting
only exact record matches, and only retrieval events.

pd audit create --commit 01G4BS0852FYK9FW9EFWTYD75J
Use the contents of commit 01G4BS0852FYK9FW9EFWTYD75J as the basis for an audit.

pd audit create --workspace
Use the contents of the current workspace's active dataset as the basis for an audit.

```

### Options

```
      --commit string       Commit ID to audit
  -f, --files               Path to files (or file glob) which include records to audit
  -h, --help                help for create
  -i, --include strings     Only include events matching the given list. Use as -i "x,y,z".
                            
                            Omitting this option will display all events. To get a list of all possible
                            events, use "pd policy list"
      --mesh                Query all nodes in data mesh
  -n, --name string         Name of report. If name is not provided, a name will be generated.
  -r, --retrieve string     Retrieve the specified report
  -t, --threshold float32   Only report matches above this threshold (0.0 - 1.0; 1.0 will report
                            exact matches only)
                            
                            When creating a report use --threshold to specify a minimum similarity score. A
                            threshold of 1.0 (the default) will report only exact matches. --threshold only
                            applies when a new report is created, and does nothing if applied to a
                            previously generated report.
                            
                            Use low threshold values cautiously. Even small amounts of subject data may
                            return a very large audit report. Especially large reports may fail. (default 1)
      --type string         FileType: specifies the format of the file to be audited. Supported file types are:
                            
                            1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
                            2) jsonarray. Each line is an array of JSON objects. Likely there is just one
                               very long line with many objects.
                            3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. Submitting CSV without a header row
                               will result in records that do not match your needs. All fields in the CSV are
                               imported as strings. You should use a different format. (default "nldjson")
      --workspace           Audit the current workspace's active dataset
```
