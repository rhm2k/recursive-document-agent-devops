## pd product retrieve

Retrieve the dataset referenced by the product and version and send to stdout

### Synopsis

Retrieve the dataset referenced by the product and release and send it to stdout.

Supported output types are:
1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
2) jsonarray. A single array with muliple objects.
3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. You probably don't want this. Each
   entry in the dataset needs to have the same number of fields. Nested objects
   are output as a string. Fields are sorted alphabetically by field name of the
   header (IE the field ordering of the output may not match the field ordering of
   the input). You should use a different format.

```
pd product retrieve <name> <version> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help          help for retrieve
      --mesh          Query all nodes in data mesh
  -p, --preview       Preview dataset; do not retieve the entire dataset
  -t, --type string   FileType: specifies the format of the file to be audited. Supported file types are:
                      
                      1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
                      2) jsonarray. Each line is an array of JSON objects. Likely there is just one
                         very long line with many objects.
                      3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. Submitting CSV without a header row
                         will result in records that do not match your needs. All fields in the CSV are
                         imported as strings. You should use a different format. (default "nldjson")
```
