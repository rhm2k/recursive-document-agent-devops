## pd workspace retrieve

Retrieve workspace dataset and send to stdout

### Synopsis

Retrieve workspace dataset and send to stdout.

For convenience, the "workspace" command may be omitted when using this command. IE
the following are equivalent:
pd workspace retrieve ...
pd retrieve ...


```
pd workspace retrieve [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help          help for retrieve
  -p, --preview       Preview dataset; do not retieve the entire dataset
  -t, --type string   OutputType: specifies the format of the file to be audited. Supported file types are:
                      
                      1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
                      2) jsonarray. Each line is an array of JSON objects. Likely there is just one
                         very long line with many objects.
                      3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. Submitting CSV without a header row
                         will result in records that do not match your needs. All fields in the CSV are
                         imported as strings. You should use a different format. (default "nldjson")
```
