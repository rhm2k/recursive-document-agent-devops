## pd workspace

Commands to manipulate workspaces

### Synopsis

Commands to manipulate workspaces. A workspace provides a place
where one may construct datasets from newly ingested files, previous ingests,
or commits. Each ingest or compose action alters the workspace's Active Dataset.
You can think of the Active Dataset as a directory containing your data. As you
add or remove data, the Active Dataset reflects those changes. 

The workspace also retails history of all changes to the active dataset, and a
previous point in that history may be restored by promoting that version. See
'pd workspace history --help' for details.

```
pd workspace [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for workspace
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --json          Print output as JSON
      --json-pretty   Pretty print output as JSON
```
