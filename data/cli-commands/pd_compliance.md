## pd compliance

Compliance checks the submitted records against a compliance policy

### Synopsis

Compliance checks that the records in the submitted files pass a
release compliance test. That is, there is a policy that grades the resemblance
of the submitted records against all existing releases. 

The default compliance policy, provided only as an example, checks if the submitted
records are a 100 percent match for a non-deprecated release to which the user
has access, the compliance passes. If the submitted records are an 85 percent
or greater match, but less than 100%, the compliance check passes, with a
warning that states that there is some degree of deviance. Otherwise, the
compliance check fails, again with a message. 

The release compliance test is expressed as a Open Policy Agent policy stored
as a versionable object in the repository. The current policy is extremely
simple, meant only as an example. Repository owners should adjust according to
their needs.
