## pd tag remove

Remove <tagname> --flags <names or ids>

### Synopsis

Remove <tagname> from the specified objects. Flags may be repeated,
or may be passed multiple values separated by comma. Some flags take object
names, others take only IDs.

```
pd tag remove [flags]
```

### Examples

```
These two are equivalent:
pd remove my_tag --branch main,other,feature
pd remove my_tag --branch main --branch other --branch feature

Multiple objects may be specified in a single invocation:
pd remove my_tag --branch main,other,feature --commit 01FTXY1D4FQEN7STPBWY2J2T5Q

If a tag fails to be removed from one of the objects, an error will be reported
for that object, and removal will continue for the remaining objects.

```
