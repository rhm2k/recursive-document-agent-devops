## pd branch ingest

Ingest files into the repository

### Synopsis

Ingest files into the repository into the specified branch, and
commit them with the specified message. Files may be a list of files or a file
glob. If --create is provided, the branch named by --branch will be created if
it does not exist. If a branch is created and --comment is provided, the
comment will be applied to the new branch.

Ingest always overwrites the dataset of the active workpace.

```
pd branch ingest <branch_name> --message <message> --file file... [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --comment string    Set comment on newly created branch
  -c, --create            Create branch if it does not exist
  -f, --files             Path to files (or file glob) to ingest
  -h, --help              help for ingest
  -m, --message string    Commit message
  -q, --quiet             Do not summarize ingest
  -t, --type string       FileType: specifies the format of the file to be audited. Supported file types are:
                          
                          1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
                          2) jsonarray. Each line is an array of JSON objects. Likely there is just one
                             very long line with many objects.
                          3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. Submitting CSV without a header row
                             will result in records that do not match your needs. All fields in the CSV are
                             imported as strings. You should use a different format. (default "nldjson")
      --userdata string   Path to file containing a single JSON object of userdata
```
