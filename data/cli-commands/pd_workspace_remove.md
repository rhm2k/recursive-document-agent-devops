## pd workspace remove

Removes records from the referenced files, commits or ingests from the currently active workspace

### Synopsis

Computes the difference between the dataset contained by the currently
active workspace and the datasets given as arguments to this command.  If files
are specified, the files' contents are ingested and the dataset resulting from
that ingest and the other supplied datasets (if any) are combined. If given one
or more ingest IDs or commit IDs, the contents of those references are
combined.

The resulting dataset becomes the working dataset in the session. The results
may be sent to stdout with --retrieve. Summaries may be suppresed with --quiet.

The --ingest, --files and --commit flags may be presented multiple times; more
than one argument may be passed to a flag in a comma-delimited fashion.
Fileglobs must be surrounded by quotes.

For convenience, the "workspace" command may be omitted when using this command. IE
the following are equivalent:
pd workspace remove ...
pd remove ...


```
pd workspace remove <files, commits or ingests [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --commit strings    Comma-separated list of commit IDs to use in constructing the difference
  -f, --files             Comma-separated list of files to ingest and use in constructing the difference
  -h, --help              help for remove
  -i, --ingest strings    Comma-separated list of ingest IDs to use in constructing the difference
  -q, --quiet             Do not summarize
  -r, --retrieve          Send the resulting dataset to stdout
  -t, --type string       FileType: specifies the format of the file to be audited. Supported file types are:
                          
                          1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
                          2) jsonarray. Each line is an array of JSON objects. Likely there is just one
                             very long line with many objects.
                          3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. Submitting CSV without a header row
                             will result in records that do not match your needs. All fields in the CSV are
                             imported as strings. You should use a different format. (default "nldjson")
  -u, --userdata string   Path to file containing a single JSON object of userdata
```
