## pd workspace add

Adds records from the referenced files, commits or ingests to the currently active workspace

### Synopsis

Computes the union between datasets given as arguments to this command
and the dataset contained by the currently active workspace. If files are
specified, the files' contents are ingested and the dataset resulting from that
ingest and the other supplied datasets (if any) are combined. If given one or
more ingest IDs or commit IDs, the contents of those references are combined.

If given the --clobber flag, the contents of the active workspace are overwritten
with the contents of the other arguments (files, ingests or commits) instead of
being combined with them.

The resulting dataset becomes the working dataset in the session. The results
may be sent to stdout with --retrieve. Summaries may be suppresed with --quiet.

The --ingest, --files and --commit flags may be presented multiple times; more
than one argument may be passed to a flag in a comma-delimited fashion.
Fileglobs must be surrounded by quotes.

For convenience, the "workspace" command may be omitted when using this command. IE
the following are equivalent:
pd workspace add ...
pd add ...


```
pd workspace add <files, commits or ingests> [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --clobber           Overwrite the contents of the active workspace
  -c, --commit strings    Comma-separated list of commit IDs to use in constructing the union
  -f, --files             List of files or file glob to ingest and use in constructing the union
  -h, --help              help for add
  -i, --ingest strings    Comma-separated list of ingest IDs to use in constructing the union
  -q, --quiet             Do not summarize
  -r, --retrieve          Send the resulting dataset to stdout
  -t, --type string       FileType: specifies the format of the file to be audited. Supported file types are:
                          
                          1) nldjson. The default. Each line is a JSON object.
                          2) jsonarray. Each line is an array of JSON objects. Likely there is just one
                             very long line with many objects.
                          3) csvwithheader. CSV with a header row. Submitting CSV without a header row
                             will result in records that do not match your needs. All fields in the CSV are
                             imported as strings. You should use a different format. (default "nldjson")
  -u, --userdata string   Path to file containing a single JSON object of userdata
```

      --json-pretty   Pretty print output as JSON
```
