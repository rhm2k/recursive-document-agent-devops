## pd peer push branch

Push all commits from branch <name_or_id> to <peername>

### Synopsis

Push all commits (and the records contained in those commits) into
peer, into the branch specified by --into-branch. If --into-branch is
not specified, a new branch will be created in the form of
"<repo>_<branchname>_<pushid>". 

Commits from the peer branch will be applied in the local branch in the same
order as they appeared in the original branch.
