## pd workspace undo

undo/revert last change made to the current session's working dataset

### Synopsis

Undo/revert last change made to the current session's working
dataset.  Revert searches backward through session history for the first
dataset that is not equal to the current dataset, and promotes it.  Reversion
skips actions that did not change the workspace's dataset. You cannot use
revert to walk backward through session history. To promote session states that
are further back than the last dataset change, or to reach states that did not
change the working dataset, use 'session history promote'
