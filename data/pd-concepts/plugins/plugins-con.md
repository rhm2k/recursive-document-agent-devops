# Concepts / Plugins

### Summary

**Plugins** are code modules that can be triggered by policies. These code modules can be written by Provenant Data, by the repository owner, or by third parties, and can greatly extend the functionality of the repository. They can be written in almost any language, have access to the repository API, and, in retrieval and ingest context, can have access to the data flowing into and out of the system.

The combination of [policies](/docs/concepts/policy) and plugins give repository owners the ability to customize and extend the behavior of the repository without limit.
