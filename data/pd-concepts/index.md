# Concepts

Provenant Data uses a number of concepts and practices originating from, or
made familiar by, Source Code Management (SCM) and Distributed Version Control
System (DVCS) tools.  However, much of the borrowed concepts and terminology
has been revised in PD to suit the unique demands of _data_ version control.
Additionally, PD incorporates a few novel ideas that are central to the way the
platform works.

* [Audit](/docs/concepts/audit): How PD maintains and presents the provenance of
  datasets
* [Data Mesh](/docs/concepts/mesh): Eliminate data silos with repository federation
* [Dataset](/docs/concepts/dataset): The foundational element of a data publishing
  platform
* [Plugins](/docs/concepts/plugins): Customize the behavior of a repository
* [Policy Engine](/docs/concepts/policy): Fine-grained and extensible control of
  data, and access
* [Publishing](/docs/concepts/publishing): Data Products, Releases and Licensing
* [Repository](/docs/concepts/repo): Data's new home
* [Schemas](/docs/concepts/schemas): Enforce rules about the shape and content of of
  datasets
* [Source Data Management](/docs/concepts/sdm): Branches, Commits, Tags, Ingests and
  more

More in-depth discussion of these and other topics may be found in the [PD Guide](/docs/guide).
